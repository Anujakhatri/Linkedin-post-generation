# Linkedin-post-generation

This project helps to generate the caption ideas with diffrent field. I just collected the sample examples from linkedin to train the LLM model so they can understand the tone, style  and context. 

The major purpose is to investigate LLM principles and the processes behind generative AI, such as prompt design, few-shot prompting, and output customisation.

 The libraries that you required to install before run the project.
