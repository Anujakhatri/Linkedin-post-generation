You're not \u201cmissing an opportunity\u201d by expecting basic respect, you\u2019re standing in your worth.\n\nIf a company can't respect your time, your availability, or even offer basic courtesy like scheduling notice, imagine what it would be like working with them long-term. \ud83d\udea9\n\nHave you ever experienced a situation like this?\n\n#VirtualAssistant #Jobseekers #ExecutiveAssistant",

Structure Over Chaos\nNo more \"tutorial hopping\" or wondering what to learn next\nA curated syllabus covers SQL, Python, visualization, and stats\u2014no gaps\n\n2. Instant Access to Mentors\nMy lecturers had 10\u201315 years of industry experience\nGot answers to \"Why does this matter in the real world?\" instantly\n\n3. Built-in Accountability\nClass WhatsApp groups kept me motivated (shared struggles > solo grinding)\nDeadlines forced consistency (no \"I\u2019ll finish this tutorial someday\")\n\n4. Credibility That Opens Doors\nIn 3/3 tech interviews I had, recruiters specifically praised:\n\"We respect that you pursued formal upskilling\"\nCertificates won\u2019t get you hired, but they get you noticed\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The Catch\nFormal education is just the foundation. You still need to:\nBuild projects (theory \u2260 hands-on skills)\nNetwork aggressively (your degree won\u2019t land you jobs\u2014people will)\nKeep learning (tools evolve faster than curricula)\n\nMy Verdict\nUniversity is worth it IF:\nYou thrive with structure\nYou leverage mentors (not just slides)\nYou treat it as step 1, not the finish line\n\nSelf-learning is better IF:\nYou\u2019re highly disciplined\nYou\u2019re targeting specific tools (e.g., \"Learn Power BI in 8 weeks\")\nYou\u2019re supplementing with certifications (Google Data Analytics, etc.)\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?\nFormal degree or self-taught\u2014what\u2019s worked for you?",
